# LSystemsDemonstration
The program is a processing implementation of an L-System parser and a turtle renderer. 
## L-Systems Class 
The L-system is implemented as a class which contains an axiom and a set of productions. 
The retNDevStep() function of the class returns a string generated using the set of
productions after the nth development step. 
## Turtle Implementation
The turtle renderer interprets the L-system string and produces either a 2D or 3D tree.
